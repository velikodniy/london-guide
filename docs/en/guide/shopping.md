## Online Shopping and Discounts

Check Amazon, then google if it's cheaper elsewhere. Just verify the seller on [Trustpilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

You can register with one of the loyalty program aggregators. For example, [TopCashback](https://www.topcashback.co.uk/) or [Complete Savings](http://completesavings.co.uk/). **Be careful: participation is often paid!** However, if you regularly buy things online, these aggregators are worthwhile.
