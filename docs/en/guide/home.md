# Housing

## Where to Find Information?

Lots of information about legal aspects of renting can be found at:

* [Shelter](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/private_renting),
* [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-a-home/).

Familiarize yourself with these resources before starting your housing search.

## Where Is It Better to Rent?

You can compare neighborhoods on [Crystal Roof](https://crystalroof.co.uk).

Often, everyone initially settles close to work, but then realizes that areas farther from the center are cheaper and more comfortable. Transport is well-developed and commuting isn't difficult. But this is all individual.

You can live outside London. Commuting to the center from the popular and comfortable Surrey can take the same time as from zones 2-3 of London, since trains are much faster than Tube trains. On the other hand, trains run less frequently and there may be no quick alternative.

Among expats, there's a tendency to first settle closer to the center but over time move further and further out.

If you have a child, definitely look for housing near a good school. When enrolling in school (better to do this as early as possible), they consider how far the child lives.

## How to Rent?

**Don't delay the rental question.** Especially if you want to move in within the next few days. It's not a quick process and full of stress.

You can rent through an agency, directly from an owner (landlord), or live with friends. The first option is better because:

* tenants have many rights and can't be easily evicted (arguably more rights than the owner);
* all issues are handled through the agency (something breaks — the agency calls a repairman and they fix everything).

You can contact an agency directly, but it's easier to search for housing on specialized websites. Most listings are from agencies anyway.

The main websites are:

* [https://www.rightmove.co.uk/](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/),
* [https://www.zoopla.co.uk/](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/).

Listings are usually the same on both sites since agencies try to show everywhere what they have.

Also check:

* [https://www.openrent.co.uk/](https://www.openrent.co.uk/) — although OpenRent listings appear on other aggregators, the site itself is quite convenient. Its distinguishing feature is that it only has "live" listings. Plus, everything is standardized, including the rental agreement. Worth checking — you might find something suitable.
* [https://www.onthemarket.com/](https://www.onthemarket.com/).

Only look at recently added properties. If a flat has been on the site for a month, it's either in terrible condition or already rented but not removed. This is very common. It makes sense to look at properties added no more than 7 days ago.

When you find a flat, always call or visit the agency in person. If you email or message through Rightmove/Zoopla, you risk not getting a response. If visiting the agency, prepare a list of requirements for the flat beforehand so they can offer you good alternatives.

**You must view all properties.** Don't trust photos. If there's no sink in the photo, it might be cracked or missing entirely.

Book viewings as early as possible. The flat may be rented within two or three days. For viewings, dress nicely and bring your partner if you have one. You need to demonstrate that you're a creditworthy client who will make regular payments. The agency will likely ask about your job (in a form or casually); you can confidently say you work at Snap or just a big tech company.

Landlords like to rent for long terms — it's beneficial for them — so say you want to stay in the area for several years and you're not inclined to move.

Properties go off the market very quickly. It's normal for a property to be listed in the morning and rented by evening. So if you're viewing properties and like something, agree immediately.

When you decide to rent a flat, you make an offer. You can offer less than the landlord is asking. They often agree to £50-100 less per month. It's best to explain why. You can cite comparable properties on the market. Check, for example, the rental valuation on [Mouseprice](https://www.mouseprice.com/). Standard practice is to ask for £50-100 less than the actual market price.

The agent will advise offering more because they supposedly already have two offers with similar amounts on the table. Don't believe it — there are no other offers; this is a standard, very common trick.

You can also offer more than asked to outbid other offers.

When making an offer, immediately list the defects that need fixing. This is standard procedure.

Be prepared for things to go wrong at any moment. Even if you've started drawing up the contract, until the landlord signs it, there are no guarantees. Such cases aren't rare, so don't leave everything to the last day. Always have a Plan B ready.

## What to Look For When Choosing Housing?

Things to look for:

* If you have children — **good schools nearby**. Remember that children here start school at 4. Schools give priority to children living nearby when enrolling. There are also several bilingual Russian-English nurseries and schools in London (both weekend and full-time, see the relevant section). If transport is an issue, it might make sense to settle nearby. For parents, this is the main factor in choosing an area.
* **Energy efficiency of the building.** Newer buildings retain heat better and have better heating.

  That said, London is a warm city and you can quite comfortably live in flats with single glazing. You can barely heat and the flat will be +18°C in winter, which is a fairly comfortable temperature you quickly get used to. But this is individual.

  It's best when the building has double glazing, but in old central London buildings, there's almost none since changing the external appearance of old buildings in conservation areas is prohibited. However, double glazing comes in different types and some aren't always convenient to open for ventilation.

  It's quite realistic to find a building with EPC rating A. In such a building, even without heating, it will be over 20°C year-round.
* **Heating, hot water, and kitchen stove.** Central heating or is there a boiler in the flat (it may be hidden, always ask)? Gas stove or induction?
* **Mold** as black spots in corners or on ceilings. Due to high humidity, it's in almost all buildings. They often try to hide it with whitewash. If it's there, it's hard to get rid of. Also check inside the washing machine and peel back the door rubber seal. There may be mold there too.
* **Condition of walls, floors, and furniture.** Creaky floors are fun only for the first few days. Same with a leaking roof.
* **Crime** in the area. You can view on the police website map.
* **Noise sources** (roads, nearby restaurants, etc.) **and air pollution** can be checked on [Crystal Roof](https://crystalroof.co.uk/).
* **Internet quality** specifically in this building. You can check on uSwitch.com or directly on Rightmove/Zoopla.

  Many buildings only have ADSL. If speeds up to 63 Mbps (or higher) are indicated — that's it. It's usable but note that high speed is only for download; upload will be around 1 Mbps. This may not be enough for work. Even if it says fibre, it might not be actual fibre.

  Good providers with FTTP fibre (fibre directly to the flat) are [Hyperoptic](https://hyperoptic.com/), [Community Fibre](https://communityfibre.co.uk/). You can check availability on provider websites.
* And so on.

**If you come to view a flat and the current tenant meets you, don't hesitate to ask them questions!** They can tell you things you won't find out any other way.

* How long have they lived here?
* Why are they moving out?
* Are the neighbors quiet?
* Do they like the area?
* How do they rate the flat?

Most people are quite open and answer honestly. Unlike the agent, they have no interest in only showing the flat in a favorable light since they're moving out anyway.

## How to Rent?

### The Offer

If you really like a flat and there are no problems with it, the general rule is — **make an offer immediately**. Good flats go off the market in a day or two — this is not an exaggeration. But if you're unsure, don't rush to sign the offer on the doorstep. Better to think for an hour, then sign.

But don't delay! Flats go off the market very quickly.

### Negotiations

**During negotiations, the agent works not on your side but the landlord's.** If they don't rent the flat to you, they'll rent it to someone else.

Agents are usually very polite and make a good impression. Don't be fooled. Honesty isn't strongly linked to impression. Also consider that after the deal, you won't deal with this person again — you'll handle flat issues with a completely different agency employee.

Note that the agent's bonus depends on the deal value. The agent will push you to raise the price. **A very common tactic is when the agent says there's an offer higher than yours. Don't believe it — often there is no second offer.**

On the other hand, you can certainly negotiate. It's one thing for the agent to lose a dozen pounds from a lower deal amount; another for the deal not to happen at all.

**For negotiations, use only email**. Try not to negotiate verbally, by phone, or on WhatsApp — immediately say you'll email. (This refers specifically to negotiations about deal terms once a suitable flat is found.) The thing is, the agent may intentionally or unintentionally mislead you and then deny everything. Misleading is a crime, so in correspondence, they'll answer precisely. Email correspondence to the agency's address can be evidence in court, unlike WhatsApp messages (where the agent could claim they weren't representing the agency).

### Holding Deposit

**Carefully read** the [**article about holding deposits**](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/holding_deposits)**.**

**Don't pay a holding deposit unless you're firmly committed to renting this specific flat and are sure what you're paying for.** They'll ask you to do this immediately, but it's better to think and weigh everything. If you change your mind and withdraw your offer, the deposit won't be refunded. It's only returned if the landlord refuses to rent to you.

Remember that **by law, a holding deposit cannot be taken twice for the same flat.** Many landlords aren't very honest and even after receiving a deposit, continue to list the flat through other agencies.

If you've paid a deposit, your agency has taken the flat off the market, but you still see the same flat on other agencies' websites, definitely tell your agent. Cite the law and say the deal risks falling through. Usually, the agent quickly contacts the landlord and the other agency to resolve it since it's in their interest.

Carefully read the preliminary agreement that asks for the deposit payment. The contract will be based on it. This agreement can only be changed later with the landlord's consent.

Make sure the agreement mentions a [break clause](https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/tenancy-agreements-a-]to-z). Not everyone needs a break clause, but if you don't know what it is or are unsure, better to add it.

### The Contract and Break Clause

When they send you the contract, read it very carefully. If possible, consult someone who already has experience renting.

Pay attention to the following:

* Check if the contract has a break clause. If not, ask to add one. See details below.
* Service charge. Usually, the landlord pays for building maintenance (not to be confused with utilities).
* Fair wear and tear. By law, you shouldn't be charged for normal wear. Make sure the contract reflects this.

  Example of normal wear — carpets. They won't wear out only if you don't walk on them, which is obviously impossible when using the premises.
* Carefully read all sections about payment. Who pays for what?

If something is unclear or you disagree with any point, always email the agent. Don't hesitate to ask even if you just don't understand a term. The agent must explain.

Remember that you'll be living according to this contract.

**Break clause** — these are the conditions under which you can terminate the contract before it ends. If this clause isn't there, even if you move out:

* you'll have to pay rent until the landlord finds a new tenant, and they may deliberately search very slowly;
* even if they find one, you'll still pay for the remaining months, just at a lower rate;
* if the new tenant rents the flat for less, you'll have to compensate the difference.

Standard practice is a break clause taking effect after half the rental term with a 3-month notice period.

If you're renting in autumn when it's very expensive, the break clause is a way to break the vicious cycle where the end of your rental term falls in autumn again. But it's best not to abuse this method since a new landlord will get references about you from the old one.

### Inventory Check

Before renting out the property, the agency conducts an inventory of the property's condition. Always check it before signing. If any defect (crack, stain, etc.) isn't recorded, ask to add it. Otherwise, when you move out, repair costs will be deducted from your deposit. It's best to photograph everything when moving in and send it to the agent by email so you can later prove the damage was already there.

### Preparing to Move

When the contract is signed:

* start notifying everyone about your address change,
* set up mail forwarding in advance (two weeks before),
* connect utilities in advance,
* book professional cleaning at the old flat (it's expensive but much simpler than cleaning everything yourself),
* find companies that handle moving (you can google "man and van").

### How to Find Service Providers?

You can change utility providers yourself. If you pay for all utilities yourself, the landlord cannot prohibit changing providers, but you need to notify them and possibly provide the name and account number. In any case, read your rental agreement beforehand — there should be a relevant clause.

You can see where you'll get better prices for electricity, gas, and internet on [uSwitch](https://uswitch.com). This site often offers discounts and bonuses.

Usually, contracts with service providers are for a set period, after which prices may increase or conditions become less favorable. So it's often sensible to look at other market offerings after the contract ends.

Carefully check contract termination conditions. You may need to pay an exit fee to break the contract, which will negate all savings from a cheaper offer.

## Waste Recycling

A significant portion of waste can be recycled. Detailed recycling information can be found on [RecycleNow](https://www.recyclenow.com/).

Before recycling:

* rinse bottles and cans, remove liquid residue;
* flatten all cardboard boxes.

Place the following in mixed recycling:

* paper and cardboard;
* metal cans from food and drinks,
* glass bottles and jars;
* cardboard liquid containers like TetraPak;
* plastic bottles, trays, tubes, and pots;
* aerosol cans (must be empty and undamaged);
* aluminum foil (washed and smoothed).

If unsure whether an item is recyclable, check [RecycleNow](https://www.recyclenow.com/) or search your borough's website.

**The following items are not recyclable** — put them in general waste:

* **dirty paper or cardboard**,
* **disposable coffee cups**, coffee machine capsules;
* shopping bags and black bags;
* polystyrene packaging;
* bubble wrap — reuse it;
* plastic film (including cling film);
* crisp packets and sweet wrappers;
* **dry and wet wipes, paper towels** (unless you specifically bought recyclable ones);
* broken glass, heat-resistant glassware (wrapped in newspaper);
* broken mirrors or glass (wrapped in newspaper);
* medicine blister packs.

If you have a garden, use food scraps as compost. If not possible, put them in general waste.

Textiles, shoes, books, and small electrical appliances can be recycled by placing them in separate special bins often found on streets.

Batteries must be recycled. You can put them in bins at some shops or libraries.

There was also a battery bin at the Snap office near Tech Lounge. Sometimes Tech Lounge holds recycling days when you can bring old electronics and unwanted cables.

Bulky waste collection must be ordered separately. If you leave a mattress on the street, you may be fined and will still have to order its collection.

Tips:

* Remember that shampoo bottles, egg cartons, cardboard toilet paper tubes, and clean foil can be recycled.
* Crushing bottles, boxes, and cans saves space in the bin.
* Help housemates and family — hang a list of recyclables on the fridge.

## Who to Notify About Address Changes?

If you've moved, set up [mail forwarding](/en/guide/communication) as soon as possible (better before moving) and notify about your address change.

* Police registration at OVRO is currently [suspended](https://met.overseasregistrations.uk/). [Sign up at OVRO or police](https://www.gov.uk/register-with-the-police/change-replace). But in 2021-2022, due to huge queues, you don't need to write to the police as they allowed reporting the new address at the appointment.
* [Notify the Home Office about your address change](https://visa-address-update.service.gov.uk/).
* Write to your council that you're moving so you stop paying council tax at the old address. If moving to another borough, register there. Usually, this can all be done online.
* Notify payroll about the change so your payslip has the correct address. It doesn't update automatically when changed in Workday.
* Notify banks about your address change as soon as possible. Usually, this can be done through banking apps.
* Notify Schwab.
* If you're registered with a GP, just find a new one near your residence, register with them, and they'll transfer all your data.

## What to Do with Unwanted Items?

Unwanted items in good condition can be donated to charity (e.g., [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/)) or sold on [eBay](https://ebay.co.uk), [Shpock](https://www.shpock.com/en-gb), [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com/), Nextdoor, or Facebook Marketplace. According to reviews, the last two are most effective.
