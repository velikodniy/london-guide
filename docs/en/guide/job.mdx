# Work and Rest

## Days Off

England has [eight public holidays and bank holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays). Many don't have fixed dates, so always check the calendar.

## How to Take Leave or Sick Leave?

Sick leave specifics are described in the [relevant section](/en/guide/health#sick-leave).

**Full-time employees are entitled to** [**28 working days of leave**](https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights) **per calendar year.** The actual number may be less since the employer can include public holidays in these 28 days in whole or in part.

These are specifically working days, meaning if you take 10 days off, you can rest for two weeks since weekends don't count.
