This document is an expanded version of my notes, which then became a small relocation guide for Snap employees that unexpectedly became popular. To make it accessible outside the company, many sections had to be removed or shortened.

The guide is constantly being updated. Feel free to contribute! If you disagree with any section or want to add something — leave a comment.

I'm not an expert in everything I write about. I've added certain sections for others. So some information may be inaccurate.
